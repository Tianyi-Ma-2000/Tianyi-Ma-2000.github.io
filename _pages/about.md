## About me
I am a first-year PhD student (starting from October 2023) at the Statistical Laboratory, University of Cambridge, supervised by [Prof Richard Samworth](https://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~rjs57/) and [Dr Tengyao Wang](https://personal.lse.ac.uk/wangt60/). Before that, I obtained my MMath and BA degrees in Mathematics from the University of Cambridge in July 2023.

## Research interests
My current research focuses on problems in missing data and robust statistics. I am also generally interested in high-dimensional statistics.

#### About me
I am a PhD student at the Statistical Laboratory, University of Cambridge, supervised by [Prof Richard Samworth](https://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~rjs57/) and [Dr Tengyao Wang](https://personal.lse.ac.uk/wangt60/). Before that, I obtained my MMath and BA degrees in Mathematics from the University of Cambridge in July 2023.

#### Research interests
I am broadly interested in robust statistics, missing data, and high-dimensional statistics. My current research focuses on developing and studying the theoretical properties of algorithms that are robust to outliers, missing data or heavy-tailed distributions.

#### About me
I am a PhD student at the Statistical Laboratory, University of Cambridge, supervised by [Prof Richard Samworth](https://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~rjs57/) and [Prof Tengyao Wang](https://personal.lse.ac.uk/wangt60/). Previously, I obtained my MMath and BA degrees in Mathematics from the University of Cambridge in July 2023. This year, I am also organising the [Statistics Clinic](https://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/clinic/statistics-clinic).  1

#### Research interests
I am generally interested in nonparametric, robust statistics, missing data, and machine learning problems. My current research focuses on developing and studying the theoretical properties of algorithms that are robust to missing data or outliers.
